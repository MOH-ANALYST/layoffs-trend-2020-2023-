Layoff Trends (2020-2023) – SQL Analysis

 # Project Overview

I analyzed layoff trends from March 11, 2020, to March 6, 2023, using SQL to see how major companies and countries were affected. The goal was to clean, explore, and break down the data to understand what’s driving these layoffs.

# Key Findings

 Top 3 Companies with the Most Layoffs

- Amazon – 18,150 layoffs
- Google – 12,000 layoffs
- Meta – 11,000 layoffs

 Top 3 Countries Affected
- United States – 256,559 layoffs
- India – 35,993 layoffs
- Netherlands – 17,220 layoffs

 # Tools & Tech Used
	-	SQL (for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis)
	- MySQL (database used)
	-	Excel / Tableau / Power BI (optional for visualizations)

 # Project Files
	-	data/ → LAYOFF TREND 2020-2023\LAYOFF DATA\layoffs.csv
	-	queries.sql → LAYOFF TREND 2020-2023\layoff project_SQL
	-	README.md → Project documentation

# What I Did

 - Cleaned and standardized the dataset (removed duplicates, fixed inconsistencies)
- Aggregated layoffs by company and country
- Identified patterns in the data (peak layoff periods, industry trends)
- Explored possible reasons behind mass layoffs

# Key Takeaways
	•	Tech giants led in layoffs, possibly due to overhiring during COVID-19 and cost-cutting measures.
	•	The U.S. had the highest layoffs, likely reflecting its dominance in the global tech industry.
	•	India and the Netherlands also saw significant layoffs, hinting at shifts in outsourcing and international labor strategies.
